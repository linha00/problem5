##What Does It Mean by Breaking Consensus?
Breaking consensus refers to a situation in a blockchain network where different nodes (participants) have conflicting views of the blockchain state. This inconsistency can arise due to changes in the protocol or data structures that are not uniformly applied across all nodes. When consensus is broken, nodes cannot agree on the validity of transactions, which can lead to forks, lost funds, and an unreliable network.

##Why Would This Change Break Consensus?
**Data Type Mismatch**: Nodes in the wallet blockchain are programmed to expect the balance field as an unsigned integer. Changing it to a string means that nodes running the previous version of the code will interpret the balance incorrectly. They might not be able to parse transactions correctly, leading to transaction validation failures.

**Transaction Validation**: The logic that verifies wallet transactions will fail if the nodes expect an integer but receive a string. This inconsistency will lead to nodes rejecting valid transactions or, conversely, accepting invalid ones based on differing interpretations of the balance field.

**State Updates**: Nodes maintain their state based on the blockchain's expected structure. If a node updates its state based on the new string type but another node does not apply this update (due to running the old code), they will diverge, leading to a split in the network.
